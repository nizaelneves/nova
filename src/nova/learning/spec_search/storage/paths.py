"""Filesystem path resolution for the spec-search subsystem.

The keystone of artifact isolation (spec §11): the resolved spec-search root
must NEVER be inside the Nova source tree. ``resolve_spec_search_root``
walks up from this module's ``__file__`` looking for a ``pyproject.toml`` that
identifies the Nova source root, then refuses to operate if the resolved
root is inside it. Defense in depth — if a user accidentally points
``NOVA_HOME`` at the repo, the system fails loudly instead of silently
writing artifacts into the working tree.
